                    My research focused on the development and productivity of Heliconia species, a genus with significant potential as cut flowers due to their morphological diversity. The study was conducted in full sun conditions in the Zona da Mata region of Pernambuco, Brazil, evaluating 16 genotypes over 31 months. Key findings included <i>H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata</i> cv. Golden Torch as the most productive small genotype and H. bihai as the only large genotype with year-round production. These results are essential for selecting superior genotypes for cultivation and breeding programs.
